=== QlikView / Qlik Sense via TIQ JDBC Connector

(Thanks a lot to Ralf Becher, TIQ Solutions)

TIQ Solutions provides a commercial product to enable JDBC connectivity in QlikView and Qlik Sense. The configuration is simple.

In QlikView, you can connect to Neo4j directly. In Qlik Sense you need to copy the CUSTOM CONNECT script code.

If your Neo4j connection is established, you now can execute Cypher queries in LOAD statements (but mention the SQL prefix). The results get loaded into memory tables as usual.
